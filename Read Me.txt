Daniel Han: IT486
Game: Realm Walker

Controls:
- left & right keys: move left & right
- space: jump
- z: melee attack (1 damage)
- x: projectile attack (2 damage)

Main Objective: navigate throughout the area and reach the end. Defeat the boss and escape through the portal to the next area.

Fall off the map and you will have to restart the game, for there is no way for you to get back up.
There are different paths for you to take. Some require a leap of faith.

Wraith: 1 health
Prowler: 1 health
Ravager: 1 health
Nashor: 2 health
Trapper: 1 health
Tower: no health
Phalanx: no health
Revenger: no health

Towers and Phalanx cannot be destroyed, so it's best to avoid them.

Boss Enemy: placed at the end (has 5 health total)

Warning: the Revenger is placed at the start of the game and will drop down as soon as you play. 
You cannot destroy him. Your only two options is to either push him off to the right with projectiles, 
or head towards left and lure him to a ravine. He cannot jump, so he should fall to his death.

Once the boss is defeated, head towards the portal to enter the next area and end the demo.
