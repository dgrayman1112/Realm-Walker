- z: melee attack (1 damage)
- x: projectile attack (2 damage)

Main Objective: Navigate throughout 2 areas and 3 rest areas to reach the portal at the end of each. Defeat the boss and escape through the portal to the third and final conversation with the NPC Masquerade.

Fall off the map and you will have to restart the game, for there is no way for you to get back up.
There are different paths for you to take. Some require a leap of faith.

Wraith: 1 health
Prowler: 2 health
Ravager: 3 health
Nashor:  5 health
Trapper: 1 health
Tower: no health
Phalanx: no health
Revenger: no health

Towers and Phalanx cannot be destroyed, so it's best to avoid them.

Boss Enemy: Hanged Man; placed at the end of Area 2 (has 20 health total).

Warning: the Revenger is placed in the game and will drop down behind you unexpectedly. 
You cannot destroy him. Your only option is to run right and lure him to a ravine. He cannot jump, so he should fall to his death.

Once the boss is defeated, head towards the portal to enter the next area and end the demo.
